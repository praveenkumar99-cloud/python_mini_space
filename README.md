##  Aim Of The Project

As a Python newbie, I understand the problems that I face when i first begin studying and attempting to understand various Data Science concepts, particularly Python. This project is to solve the basic problems that i encounter using Python principles and exploring GitHub.

My goal is to build a common playground where upskill myself from beginner to expert, to learn and share knowledge.

Let's "folk-ing" create amazing things together! ðŸ‘‰
